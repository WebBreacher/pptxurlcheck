Pptxurlcheck searches all slide bullets and notes pages for URLs, and attempts
to retrieve the URL. By default, URLs that are valid (e.g. that return a 200
OK message) are not displayed; all other URLs are displayed along with the
return code. `ERR` indicates that the server could not be reached. If you
want to see each URL that is tested, set the environment variable `SKIP200` to
`0`:

```
$ SKIP200=0 ~/Dev/pptxurlcheck/pptxurlcheck.py SEC555/SEC555_1_G01_01_JH.pptx
URL validation report created at SEC555/pptxurlreport.csv.
$ head -4 SEC555/pptxurlreport.csv
File#,Page,Response,URL,Note
1,7,200,https://content.fireeye.com/m-trends,
1,7,200,https://sec555.com/2g,
1,9,500,https://sec555.com/2i,
```

Windows users can set an environment variable before running the `set` command:

```
C:\>set SKIP200=0
C:\>pptxurlcheck SEC561.pptx
...
```

Optionally, a file ending with a `.txt` extension may be added at any position
in the command line. This file should include a list of URLs to ignore from
the URL check report, one per line. The URL in the ignore file must be an exact
match for the URL in the PowerPoint file to be ignored:

```
$ cat ignoreurls.txt
