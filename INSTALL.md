# pptxsanity
Parse a PowerPoint PPTX file, extracting all URLs from notes and slides, and test for validity returning ERR or the non-OK HTTP status code.

## Installing on Linux or OS X
Pptxsanity requires the python-pptx module (and its associated dependencies).  Install using `pip`.

```
$ pip install python-pptx
```

## Installing on Windows
Windows users can download and run the EXE file included in the `bin/` directory.  Copy this file to a location in your PATH (I copy to C:\Tools - YMMV).
